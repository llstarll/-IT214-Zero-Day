<h1> what is our real consumption of The water ? </h1>
  <div>



  <p>The problem it’s how we’re using water. Humans need to drink about 3.7 liters of water per day. Washing your teeth and hands consumes about 3.7-11.7 liters. But drinking, washing and flushing the toilet for every person on Earth only accounts for 8% ؜ of our freshwater use each year.
  Most of the water goes to agriculture and industry, and into the food and the products we use.
  The Coca-Cola bottle, for example, 98% of that bottle's water is not what you see in that bottle actually. 98% of the water is embedded in all the ingredients that were grown to make that Coca-Cola bottle.
</p>

  <p>Coffee cup? 130 liters
  Each of your cotton shirts is 2,500 liters.
  But nothing has as much embedded water as meat.
</p>

  <p>Alfalfa is a common ingredient in livestock feed, and growing a kilogram of it takes 510 liters of water. An average cow consumes about 12 kilograms of alfalfa daily.
  A mere 113 grams of hamburger would require 1650 liters of water to produce.
</p>

  <p>Water doesn’t abide by some of the basic rules of capitalism. Farmers hardly pay for it, so the true cost of water doesn't end up in the cost of the hamburger. Which is why those fast food restaurants can offer you bargain burger.
  In most places in the world water is treated and priced like there will always be enough of it.
</p>

    <p>Arid Southern California uses over than 7.5 trillion liters of water a year , to grow alfalfa, which they get from the Colorado River.
  The amount they pay for it doesn’t even cover the cost of delivery. Just a fraction of the water used by South Africa's wine industry.  Would be enough for Cape Town taps.
</p>

    <p>India and China both grow their most water intensive crops in some of their driest regions.  But as water gets more scarce, that may changes.
  The bank Goldman Sachs Predicting the water would be the Petroleum of the 21st Century.  And private interests, like hedge funds have started buying up water, prompting fears that they’ll take advantage of scarcity to turn a profit.
</p>

  <p>But putting a higher price on water might have benefits , The benefits of valuing water as we should.
  And 95% of the irrigated farmland in the world probably wouldn’t use the most inefficient irrigation method .
</p>

   <p>government might decide it’s worth the money to repair our water infrastructure.
  Mexico City, which is facing an existential water crisis, loses close to half drinking water to leak pipes.
  We value water so little, we dump two million tons of sewage and agricultural and industrial waste into it every day.
</p>

    <p>In 2017, the City of Mexicali finalized a deal
   with Constellation Brands Companies.
  The makers of Modelo and Corona beer, to construct a brewery.  It would be the biggest investment the region had seen in years, creating 750 permanent jobs.
</p>

  <p>And , in exchange the brewery was guaranteed a lot of water. But Mexicali doesn’t have a lot of water to spare. Its main water source is the Colorado River, which starts in Colorado in the United States.
  Fed by melting snow in the Rocky Mountains. Warmer temperatures in recent years have meant less snow, which means less river.

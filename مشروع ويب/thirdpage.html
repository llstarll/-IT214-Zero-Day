    <h1> that our fates are tied to what rushes out of our taps! </h1>
    <p> The more scarce water gets, more access to it becomes a competition, with winners and losers,often with government picking.
    In July 2018, the Federal Government of Mexico issued a decree making it easier for businesses like Constellation Brand companies to extract surface water all around the country.
    </p>

    <p> In January 2018 , The protesters tried to physically block the construction of the brewery’s aqueduct.
      Water scarcity is increasingly driving violent conflict around the world.
    </p>

    <p> Water scarcity is at the heart of the ingoing conflict in Darfur, which , since 2003 has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. As tensions rise over freshwater, government are increasingly eyeing an idea that was once far fetched. Creating more of it.
    Desalination of Ocean water has more than double over the last decade but the amount we make a year still add up to less than 1% of the water we use .
    </p>

     <p> To Desalination is taking ocean water or brackish water that has a lot salts in it from underground, and treat it to drinking water standards. That takes a lot of money and it takes a huge amount of energy right now.
    That would make more sense if the water was more expensive, but that would also mean the water in everything would cost more. The price of consumer goods would skyrocket. some industries might collapse . Companies like Constellation Brands might make different decisions about where they set up their operations.
    </p>

     <p> Growing cattle feed in the desert. This is the job of many families. and if water suddenly became the next petroleum, they will be without work. The thing is water is not like petroleum, or any other commodity on Earth for that matter , because without water we die.
    </p>

      <p> In 2010, the UN recognized access to water and sanitation as a human right. And that the challenge of our water crisis. How are you supposed to value an invaluable resource while ensuring everybody has it? When the price of water is raised to fix pipes or encourage conservation, it has the greatest impact on the poor.It might be that we don’t end up treating all water equal.
    </p>

    <p> In 2017, Philadelphia started experimenting with tying water prices to income.
    The fact that we all need water makes this crisis exceptionally hard, but it can also inspire people to act in special ways to solve it .
    </p>

    <p> Day Zero in Cape Town was first scheduled for March 18, but then people started conserving .
    By early 2018 , the city’s water consumption was less than half what it had been just four years earlier, and the Zero Day countdown clock was paused indefinitely.
    </p>

    <p> But Cape Town m also got lucky it rained. The trick is recognizing how valuable  water before there isn’t enough of it, and remember that our fates are tied to what rushes out of our taps.
